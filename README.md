# Arduino Controlled Smart Home

Welcome to the Arduino Controlled Smart Home project! This GitHub repository contains all the necessary code and resources to create a smart home system using an Arduino board, a mobile application, and Bluetooth connectivity. With this system, you can control eight different appliances in your home based on various modes or scenarios.

## Features

- Control eight different appliances using Arduino board and Bluetooth connectivity.
- Mobile application and dashboard with five different modes for controlling the appliances.
- Customizable modes and scenarios to suit your specific needs.
- Easy-to-use interface for managing and monitoring your smart home.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Arduino board (compatible with Bluetooth connectivity)
- Mobile device (Android or iOS) with Bluetooth capability
- Arduino IDE or compatible software
- Mobile application development environment (e.g., Android Studio, Xcode)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAzewail/arduino-controlled-smart-home.git
```

2. Set up the Arduino board and ensure it is properly connected to your appliances.

1. Open the Arduino IDE (or compatible software) and upload the Arduino sketch from the `arduino` directory to your Arduino board.

1. Set up your mobile application development environment and import the mobile application project from the `mobile-app` directory.

1. Build and run the mobile application project on your mobile device.

### Usage

1. Power on the Arduino board and ensure it is properly connected to your appliances.

1. Launch the mobile application on your mobile device.

1. Pair the mobile device with the Arduino board using Bluetooth connectivity.

1. Once connected, you can choose from the five different modes available in the mobile application to control your appliances.

1. Customize the modes and scenarios according to your preferences by modifying the code in the Arduino sketch and the mobile application project.
